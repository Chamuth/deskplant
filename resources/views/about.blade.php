            <p style="margin-top:10px;">This simple idea was the seed for what would become Deskplant LK: a modern plant destination for the modern plant lover. Plants make us happier, healthier, more efficient and boost our creativity. They even clean the air we breathe. But all our modern city-living has us indoors a lot. So we thought: why not bring the outdoors in? We think everyone deserves to have their own personal plant oasis. And, we think finding your new plant should be, well, easy.</p>
